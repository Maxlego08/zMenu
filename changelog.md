# ToDo

- [ ] Improve the firework system to put more buttonOption. Being able to put several effects, power etc.
- [ ] Add a system that allows you to cache an ItemStack, so instead of returning the ItemStack at each opening, there
  can be several minutes without having to recreate a new ItemStack. For decorations, buttons without placeholders for
  example.
- [ ] Add an order to display the list of official addons.
- [ ] Add a ``/zm command <command> <inventory>`` command to create an order file for an inventory.
- [ ] Add a system to translate plugin messages.
- [ ] Update developer doc
- [ ] Add a chance system for actions
- [ ] Add has experience / level for requirement
- [ ] Add is near for requirement
- [ ] Add delay support for zMenuConvert
- [ ] Add boolean for enable or disable inventory to load
- [ ] Add nbt support
- [ ] Upgrade potion support for multiple effect, main effect and color
- [ ] Remove config.json and setup a config.yml
- [ ] Create an extension for vscode, notepadd++ to configure the plugin faster
- [ ] Upgrade `/zmenu save <name>` to add support for heads, fireworks and banner etc
- [ ] When loading inventories, check the name, or the color of the item or the name of the inventory will contain a
  placeholders, so do not call placeholder API if it is not useful. The same can be done on messages, commands or any
  other action that uses placeholder API
- [ ] Add the Pagination button, it will allow to take an input number, an output number and browse the value number
- [ ] Add a way to display the list of online players in a button list
- [ ] Add Citizen and [ZNPCsPlus](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/znpcsplus.109380/) support to open an inventory by
  clicking on an NPC
- [ ] Fix the bug about the `clearInventory: true`. It does not restore inventory when the menu is closed.
- [ ] Add the support for
  the `http://textures.minecraft.net/texture/e34969c2684e4f62d5f87875460441a9f849d296c01e4c621636bb6acda696f7` in the
  URL of a custom head.
- [ ] Add matrix support for slot (like
  this: https://abstractmenus.github.io/docs/general/item_format.html#way-4-matrix)
- [ ] Adding more logs on the errors that can occur with custom items like ItemAdder, this will cause an error but the
  user will not have the information of why, for example when the item does not exist.
- [ ] Create a new class for loading buttons to add more elements, like a boolean to check if the button needs an
  itemstack
- [ ] Can split a file into several and thus avoid having too large files
- [ ] Add slot type for create pattern (Allows to fill slot areas as do the outline of the inventory)

- [ ] Ajouter un systéme qui permet de load un inventaire uniquement quand tout les requirements sont pr�sents

# Unreleased

# 1.1.0.1

- Added player target with inventory name [#169](https://github.com/Maxlego08/zMenu/pull/169)
- Added player data convert with ``/zm player convert``, convert old JSON data to SQL
- Update to last [CurrenciesAPI](https://github.com/GroupeZ-dev/CurrenciesAPI) version
- Use EntityScheduler instead of RegionScheduler [#168](https://github.com/Maxlego08/zMenu/pull/168)
- Fix items attributes

# 1.1.0.0

- Codebase structure overhaul: the project now uses Gradle. This major change has enabled numerous modifications and improvements to the API. The API is now cleaner, more efficient, and easier to use. **You will need to update all your plugins that use zMenu at the same time** to avoid compatibility issues.
- Upgraded to Java 21, and the minimum supported Minecraft version is now 1.19. Since very few servers using zMenu were still on older versions, we decided to drop support for legacy Minecraft versions. This simplifies the codebase and opens the door to many new enhancements.
- Added a `config.yml` file. You can now delete the old `config.json` file. New configuration options are also available.
- Integrated database support. This allows logging of opened inventories by players and enables cleaner data storage compared to JSON files.
- Added `/zm players removeall <key>` command, which removes a specific key from all players.
- Added support for mathematical expressions in placeholder requirements and `player data` actions. To enable math operations, set `math: true`. See `cookie.yml` for examples on how to use math expressions.
- Added `%zmenu_math_<expression>%` placeholder to perform math operations via a placeholder.
- Added `%zmenu_formatted_math_<expression>%` placeholder to perform math operations and return a formatted value.
- Introduced a validation system for command arguments. This lets you define the expected argument type to ensure correct values are used in your commands.
- Added `tooltip-style: <style>` option.
- Introduced a cache system for online players to improve performance by avoiding repeated lookups for offline player data.
- Added `cancel-item-pickup: <true/false>`, which prevents players from picking up items while an inventory is open.
- Added `item-model: <model>` option to customize the item’s model.
- Added support for potion arrows using `arrow: true`.
- Added `player command as op` action, which executes a command as if the player were OP. ⚠️ Be cautious: this gives the player all permissions during command execution.
- Added support for **ExecutableItems** and **ExecutableBlocks**.
- Added the **SWITCH** button. This displays a button based on the result of a placeholder, simplifying your configuration. See `switch.yml` for an example.
- Added `refresh inventory` action to reload the inventory content.
- Dates now include **month and year** in their display.

``` 

Be careful, you must put an ``s`` to **placeholder**, otherwise it will not work.

- You can use now the text ``placeholder`` instanceof ``placeHolder``
- Start new way to configure the plugin, you have now ``requirement`` and ``actions``:
  A requirement consists of a permission list to check (placeholder, permission, regex and item), an action list on
  success and an action list on deny.

1. broadcast
2. broadcast_sound
3. close
4. connect
5. console_command
6. data
7. inventory
8. message
9. chat
10. player_command
11. sound

Example for ``view_requirement``:

```yml
view_requirement:
  deny:
    - type: chat
      messages:
        - "msg Maxlego08 test"
  success:
    - type: sound
      sound: ENTITY_PLAYER_LEVELUP

      value: "yes"
      action: equals_string
```

Example for ``open_requirement``:

```yml
open_requirement:
  requirements:
    - type: regex
      input: "%player_item_in_hand%"
      regex: "(NETHERITE_|DIAMOND_|IRON_|GOLDEN_|STONE_|WOODEN_|LEATHER_|BOW|CROSSBOW|FISHING_ROD|SHEARS|SHIELD|TRIDENT|TURTLE_HELMET|ELYTRA|FLINT_AND_STEEL)"
  deny:
    - type: message
      messages:
        - "&cYou doesn't have an item in your hand."
```

Example for ``click_requirement``:

```yml
click_requirement:
  left_click:
    clicks:
      - LEFT
      - SHIFT_LEFT
    requirements:
      - type: placeholder
        placeholder: "%player_gamemode%"
        value: "CREATIVE"
        action: equals_string
    deny:
      - type: inventory
        inventory: "example"
        plugin: "zMenu"
    success:
      - type: message
