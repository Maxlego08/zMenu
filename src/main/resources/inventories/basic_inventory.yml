# Size (https://docs.zmenu.dev/configurations/inventories#size)
#
# Allows to set the size of the inventory.
# The inventory size must be a multiple of 9. So you can put 9, 18, 27, 36, 45 and 54
# If this option is not present in the configuration, then the default will be 54
#
size: 18

# Inventory name (https://docs.zmenu.dev/configurations/inventories#name)
#
# This is the title of your inventory. You can put anything in it.
# Color code and placeholders are supported.

#
name: "&7Basics Menu"

# Item section. (https://docs.zmenu.dev/configurations/inventories#items)
#
# This is where you will add all the items that will be present in your inventory.
# With zMenu, each item is a Button. A button will allow you to perform specific actions, such as opening a new inventory, changing pages, going back.
# By default, the button will be of type NONE. All buttons will have the same configuration elements.
# Only buttons with types like INVENTORY, BACK etc... will have specific configuration elements.
# All button information here: https://docs.zmenu.dev/configurations/buttons
#
items:
  # Here you will specify a name for your button. No matter what you put, the name will only be present in the configuration.
  # Attention, the name of your button must be unique. We advise you to choose a name that will describe what the button does.
  myFirstButton:
    # As indicated, each button will have a specific type. To specify the type of button you must put this. (https://docs.zmenu.dev/configurations/buttons#type)
    # By default, the type will be NONE, so you must set this value only if your button is something other than NONE. We will see in more detail the different type of button in another button if below
    type: NONE
    # Slots that you want to put the item. Starts from 0 (https://docs.zmenu.dev/configurations/buttons#slot)
    slot: 4
    # You will now specify the content of your item. The item will include all configuration items that will be displayed in the inventory, name, lore etc.
    # https://docs.zmenu.dev/configurations/items
    item:
      # Let’s start with a block of grass
      # To find the list of materials you must go to the spigot documentation: https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/org/bukkit/Material.html
      # You can also set a material from another plugin, such as ItemAdder for example. All information here: https://docs.zmenu.dev/configurations/items#material
      material: GRASS
      # Here we will name this item (https://docs.zmenu.dev/configurations/items#name)

      # This is the lore. (https://docs.zmenu.dev/configurations/items#lore)

        - "&7Congratulations, you will now discover"
        - "&7all the possibilities of zMenu."

  # Create a second button, but this time let’s show your head. This will also be a NONE button, so we won’t specify it.
  mySecondButton:
    # Slots that you want to put the item. Starts from 0 (https://docs.zmenu.dev/configurations/buttons#slot)
    slot: 9
    # We will add an item with the head of the player who will open the inventory.
    item:
      # This allows you to specify a nickname to display a player head. To display the head of the player who will open the inventory you must use the placeholder %player%
      # You do not need to specify the material and/or data, the plugin will automatically do it.
      playerHead: "%player%"
      # As for the first button you can specify a name and a lore
      name: "&2%player%'s head"
      lore:
        - "&7Here is your head !"
        - ""
        - "&fSo it’s simple, right ?"
        - "&fLet’s continue the discovery of the plugin."

  # Now let’s create a third button, it will be a head with a cake skin and when we click on it a command will be executed by the console.
  myThirdButton:
    # Slots that you want to put the item. Starts from 0 (https://docs.zmenu.dev/configurations/buttons#slot)
    slot: 17
    # We will add an item with the cake head
    item:
      # To put a head with a specific skin, you can directly put the value of the skin. Here we have a cake skin that was picked up here: https://minecraft-heads.com/custom-heads/food%20&%20drinks/65273-cake
      # You do not need to specify the material and/or data, the plugin will automatically do it.
